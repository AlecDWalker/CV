## Alec Walker

I am a London-based STEM graduate with a diverse set of skills and interests spanning creative and technical fields. I obtained a 2:1 BSc in Zoology from the University of Leeds, performed in critically-acclaimed shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and have spent the last two years working for BioMed Central, a pioneer of online, open-access scientific publishing. I am excited to be working in tech because of opportunity to tackle complex, multi-dimensional challenges.

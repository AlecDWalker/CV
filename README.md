## Alec Walker

I am a young, London-based STEM graduate with a diverse set of skills and interests spanning creative and technical fields. I obtained a 2:1 BSc in Zoology from the University of Leeds, performed in critically-acclaimed shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and have spent the last two years working for BioMed Central, a pioneer of online, open-access scientific publishing. I am excited to be working in tech because of opportunity to tackle complex, multi-dimensional challenges.

## Skills

#### High level of computer literacy
I have a firm grounding in core IT programs, and an aptitude for quickly learning new systems. I am always eager to expand my technical repertoire.

- Good knowledge of and comfort with Microsoft Office software including Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook
- Extensive use of multiple record-keeping and Content Management Systems in my position as an Editorial Assistant at BioMed Central
- Rapidly achieved a high level of technical proficiency in previously unknown programs, and used this knowledge to update, maintain and customise a portfolio of over forty journal websites.
- Example: Frequently updating journal web pages to highlight featured articles, conference dates and news within relevant research fields. This often required the implementation of images, videos, internal and external web links, and placeholder content items linked to internal data stores.

#### Communication and inter-personal skills

I have fostered strong communication skills through my professional and personal exploits. I am a confident speaker and presenter, capable of working comfortably alone or within a group. I have been involved in organising and leading technical training sessions for newer team members at my previous position.

- I have held major roles in many theatre productions, including two critically-acclaimed runs at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In addition to being a creative passion, these projects have strengthened my public speaking and presentation skills.
- I contributed to the growth of the public profile of several scientific journals a in my role at BioMed Central, often through identifying new and interesting articles and pitching them in person to the communications team.
- I have worked in public-facing and customer service roles as a shop assistant and a Goods in and Distribution assistant. Both positions involved meeting and interacting with the general public on a daily basis.
- I am proficient in relaying technical information in an efficient, accessible manner, as evidenced by a blog post I authored in my role at BioMed Central to accompany a featured article (https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/on-biology/2017/07/20/hearts-minds-mice-men-mechano-growth-factor-new-tool-battle-age-related-neuron-loss/)

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I am an avid player of board games, card games and videogames across a broad range of genres and platforms. I am very interested in game design, and am hoping to find a role in the videogame industry.

I also greatly enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, having run a two and a half-year campaign as Game Master for a group of seven players.

I have acted in many school / college/ university productions and have performed as part of a theatre company at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

## Alec Walker

I am a London-based STEM graduate with a diverse set of skills and interests spanning creative and technical fields. I obtained a 2:1 BSc in Zoology from the University of Leeds, performed in critically-acclaimed shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and have spent the last two years working for BioMed Central, a pioneer of online, open-access scientific publishing. I am excited to be working in tech because of opportunity to tackle complex, multi-dimensional challenges.

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I am an avid player of board games, card games and videogames across a broad range of genres and platforms. I am very interested in game design, and am hoping to find a role in the videogame industry.

I also greatly enjoy Dungeons and Dragons, having run a two and a half-year campaign as Game Master for a group of seven players.
